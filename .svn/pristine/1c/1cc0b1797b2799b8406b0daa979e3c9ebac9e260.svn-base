#  User Configurable Items when Building RTEMS Cross Compilation Toolset
#
#  Localize these variables to match the tool versions, install point,
#  and various build options for RTEMS and the GNU tools.
#
#  In general terms, this file in conjunction with the various bit*
#  scripts do nothing that can not be done via directly using each
#  packages configuration and build instructions.  What the scripts
#  attempt to protect you from is knowing the sequencing and dependency
#  information between the various components.
#

#
#  INSTALL_POINT: Directory tools and RTEMS are installed into.
#      Recommended installation point for various OS's:
#         Linux:    /usr/local/rtems
#         Solaris:  /opt/gnu/rtems
INSTALL_POINT=/opt/rtems

#  GNU Tool Configuration Options
#

# Binutils version and source directory
#BINUTILS=binutils-2.10

# GCC version and source directory
#GCC=gcc-2.95.2

# Set to "yes" if you want to build languages other than C and C++.
# The set of alternative languages includes Java, Fortran, and Objective-C.
# These alternative languages do not always build cross.
BUILD_OTHER_LANGUAGES=no

# Newlib version and source directory
#NEWLIB=newlib-1.9.0

# GDB version and source directory
#GDB=gdb-5.0

# Set this to "yes" if you want to attempt to build documentation
# for the tools.  This requires support tools like makeinfo.
BUILD_DOCS=no

#
# RTEMS Configuration Information
#

# RTEMS version and source directory

# Set this to yes if you want to enable a more robust set of
# POSIX functionality including POSIX threads support.

# Set this to yes if you want to enable the RTEMS uITRON 3.0 API
# implementation.  This API is not completely implemented and 
# volunteers are encouraged to assist in finishing it.

# Set this to yes if you want to enable a remote debugging
# via Ethernet.  Currently this is not supported on all ports
# of RTEMS.

# Set this to yes if you want to enable maintainer mode functionality
# in the Makefile system.
ENABLE_RTEMS_MAINTAINER_MODE=no

# Set this to yes if you want to build the optimized version of RTEMS.
